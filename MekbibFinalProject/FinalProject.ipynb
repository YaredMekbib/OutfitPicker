    " For this project I created an automatic outfit picker that picks your outfit depending on the weather. It first asks whether or not its hot or cold, and depending on the answer it will ask you for what color tshirts/shorts you own or what color long sleeves/pants you own. Depending on the weather and color combinations you enter, the program will return a random pairing of dark top wear/light bottom wear or light bottom wear/dark top wear.\n",

    "-Import random module and install nltk module\n",

    "-Hit enter after each specific COLOR of article of clothing. (EG: What light colored long sleeves do you own? *Type \"White\" then hit *enter*)\n",
    "\n",
    "-Type \"Done\" when you have completed entering the corresponding article of clothing\n",
